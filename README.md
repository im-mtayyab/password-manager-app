# Password Manager Application

## Overview
A secure web-based password manager application built with PHP that allows users to safely store and manage their account credentials. The application uses strong encryption methods to protect sensitive data and implements email-based OTP verification for enhanced security.

## Features
- Secure password storage with strong encryption
- Two-factor authentication using email OTP
- User-friendly interface for managing credentials
- Email notifications for security events
- Robust user authentication system

## Prerequisites
- PHP 7.4 or higher
- MySQL/MariaDB
- XAMPP (recommended) or alternative PHP development environment
- Composer (PHP package manager)
- Gmail account for SMTP services

## Development Environment Setup

### XAMPP Setup
1. Download and install XAMPP from https://www.apachefriends.org/
2. Start Apache and MySQL services from XAMPP Control Panel
3. Clone this repository to `C:\xampp\htdocs\` (Windows) or `/opt/lampp/htdocs/` (Linux)
4. Access the application at `http://localhost/password-manager-app`

### Database Configuration
1. Open phpMyAdmin (http://localhost/phpmyadmin)
2. Create a new database named `password_manager_db`
3. Navigate to the project's Setup folder
4. Run the following setup files in order:
   - `DB_Create.php` - Creates the database
   - `Table_Creation.php` - Sets up required tables

### Composer Setup
1. Install Composer from https://getcomposer.org/
2. Open terminal/command prompt in the project root
3. Install dependencies:
   ```
   composer install
   ```
4. This will install required packages including PHPMailer

### Environment Configuration
1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
2. Configure the following in `.env`:
   ```
   # Database Configuration
   DB_HOST=localhost
   DB_USERNAME=root
   DB_PASSWORD=
   DB_NAME=password_manager_db

   # SMTP Configuration for Gmail
   SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
   SMTP_USERNAME=your-email@gmail.com
   SMTP_PASSWORD=your-app-specific-password
   SMTP_PORT=587

3. Use Composer for dependency management
4. Regular testing of security features
5. Follow PHP best practices and coding standards

## Usage
1. Start XAMPP and ensure Apache and MySQL are running
2. Navigate to `http://localhost/password-manager-app`
3. Register a new account
4. Verify your email through OTP
5. Start managing your passwords securely

## Security Best Practices
- Regularly update your master password
- Enable two-factor authentication
